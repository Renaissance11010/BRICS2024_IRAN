    "##### in this project, our mission is to fly several quadcopters collectively and perform formation operations while flying and sitting at the desired locations.  After we create paths in a software like blender+skybrush, a large number of set points are created that contain position information at any given time. In order to be able to give this data as input to the autopilot, we also need to obtain the initial velocity at each point. To do this, we use a derivative rule. In this derivation method, we use finite differences of the first order, and by deriving from position coordinates, we get the velocity. We consider the initial velocity to be zero for the first derivative at the initial position. Now we update the obtained data as below.\n",

    "###### Because we want the equipment to be cheap and the implementation done with the least use of companion computers, so the stack we use is just a GPS module, and our communication link protocol is mavsdk. Our platform is px4+piwhawk. "
